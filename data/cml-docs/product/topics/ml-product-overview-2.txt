 ML workspaces support fully-containerized execution of Python, R, Scala, and Spark workloads through flexible and extensible engines. AI applications Analytical Applications provide a place to host long running applications within a CML project. While CML offers a place for Data Scientists to perform advanced analytics and models into production, Analytical Applications provides a place to host long running applications within a CML project. This opens up a larger group of users to the insights discovered in CML. Applications can be built with a variety of frameworks like Flask and Streamlit. They run within their own isolated compute instance which keeps them from timing out and they take advantage of ML Runtimes. Applications are accessible to users through the web. Applications can be for a variety of use cases like hosting interactive data visualizations or providing a UI frontend for a deployed mode in CML. Exploratory Data Science CML enables data practitioners to discover, query, and easily visualize their data sets all within a single user interface. The beginning of every data science project begins with finding and understanding the data you need. CML brings all the tools you need for exploratory data analysis together in a single UI so that data practitioners don't have to jump between applications, and IT doesn't have to support multiple tools. CML provides users with a view of available data assets that they can connect to, a sql editor to query those data sources, and an easy-to-use drag-and-drop visualization tool to understand your data and communicate insights.
