Architecture OverviewCloudera Docs Architecture Overview  Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) is a Data Service on the CDP platform. Residing on the CDP          platform helps CML integrate with and leverage other Data Services residing on the          platform, for example Data Engineering and Data Warehouse.   ProvisioningCML utilizes the CDP Control Plane to manage Data Services so you can provision and       delete CML Workspaces. CDP Control Plane leverages cloud native capabilities to dynamically       access CPU, memory, and GPU resources along with cloud-managed Kubernetes (K8s) to provide the       infrastructure. CML ArchitectureOnce a CML workspace is provisioned, you can start using Cloudera Machine Learning       (CML) for your end-to-end Machine Learning workflow. ML RuntimesML Runtimes are responsible for running data science workloads and intermediating       access to the underlying cluster. Spark on KubernetesIn Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), multiple Spark versions are available through       Runtime Addons. Data Scientists can select the version of Spark to be configured for any       workload. CML configures the Runtime container and mounts all of the dependencies.
