ProvisioningCloudera Docs Provisioning CML utilizes the CDP Control Plane to manage Data Services so you can provision and       delete CML Workspaces. CDP Control Plane leverages cloud native capabilities to dynamically       access CPU, memory, and GPU resources along with cloud-managed Kubernetes (K8s) to provide the       infrastructure.  During provisioning the Machine Learning application is configured to authenticate end          users of the service (ML) via the CDP identity provider, which is "chained" back to the          customer's identity provider. As a result, Machine Learning provisioned instances allow for          seamless customer SSO.  When you provision a CML workspace, the following happens:     CDP Control Plane performs the following in the cloud environment:  Requests a TLS Certificate and domain name with the cloudera.site domain Identifies the SSO configuration Identifies the SDX configuration for the environment    CDP Control Plane provisions a managed Kubernetes cluster  CDP Control Plane installs CML into the Kubernetes environment  Storage is mounted directly via managed service providers   CML uses the cloud provider load balancer and networking infrastructure to partition the          resources. CML also leverages the cloud provider infrastructure to enable the customer to          specify autoscaling.  CML provisions the DNS and the certificate. CML renews the certificates for the customer on          an ongoing basis.   Parent topic: Architecture Overview
