CML uses an NFS server, i.e. a POSIX-compliant file system, for storing users' project             files, which include user code, libraries installed into a Session, and small data             files. For AWS, CML creates an Elastic File System (EFS) file system when provisioning             the workspace for storing project files. For Azure, users can either provide an NFS             volume created in Azure NetApp Files or an external NFS server when provisioning CML             workspaces for storing project files. This NFS server is supplied to the CML workspaces             as Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PVs). Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are set up             per-namespace, and each user gets their own namespace - thus each user's view of the NFS             server is limited to that exposed by the PVC.
