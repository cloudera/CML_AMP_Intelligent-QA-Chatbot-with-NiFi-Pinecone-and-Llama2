Apache Ozone is a scalable, redundant, and distributed object store optimized for big data workloads. Apart from scaling to billions of objects of varying sizes, applications that use frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache YARN and Apache Hive work natively on Ozone object store without any modifications.

HDFS works best when most of the files are large but HDFS suffers from small file limitations. Ozone is a distributed key-value object store that can manage both small and large files alike. Ozone natively supports the S3 API and provides a Hadoop-compatible file system interface. Ozone object store is available in a CDP Private Cloud Base deployment.
