# Intelligent QA Chatbot with NiFi, Pinecone, and Llama2
In this Applied ML Prototype (AMP) we leverage Cloudera DataFlow (CDF) to scrape a website and load the vectors generated with Cloudera Machine Learning (CML). The prototype deploys an Application in CML using a Llama2 model from Hugging Face to answer questions augmented with knowledge extracted from the website. This prototype introduces Pinecone as a database for storing vectors for semantic search.

## AMP Architecture
![](/assets/architecture.png)


## Building your custom knowledge base
To build your own custom knowledge base, you will want to follow the instructions [here](USER_START_HERE/Build_Your_Own_Knowledge_Base_Tools/README.md) in the folder `USER_START_HERE`. There are guides for a CDF and Pythonic implementation of how to do this. Then, you will want to rerun the `Populate Vector DB` Job to ensure your vector DB has the latest embeddings. If you already have documents to fill the knowledge base with, simply copy them directly to the `/data` directory, and rerun the `Populate Vector DB` Job.

## Understanding the User Inputs

### Inputs
**Select Model** - Here the user can select the Llama2 7B parameter chat model (`llama-2-7b-chat`)

**Select Temperature (Randomness of Response)** - Here the user can scale the randomness of the model's response. Lower numbers ensure a more approximate, objective answer while higher numbers encourage model creativity.

**Select Number of Tokens (Length of Response)** - Here several options have been provided. The number of tokens the user uses directly correlate with the length of the response the model returns.

**Topic Weight** - The concept of a topic weight allows the user to further curate a model's response by ensuring it closely aligns to the known context.

**Question** - Just as it sounds; this is where the user can provide a question to the model

### Outputs
**Llama2 Model Response** - This is the response generated by the model given the context in your vector database. Note that if the question cannot correlate to content in your knowledge base, you may get hallucinated responses.

**Context Data Source(s)** - By default, only one data source is provided to the model (this can be adjusted in the project source code). This is provided to help the user understand what data was fed as context to the model and if its response can be trusted given the data source. This supposes good naming conventions for the datasets in `/data/*`

**Pinecone Match Score** *(Pinecone only)*- This can be thought of as a relevancy score. A lower number may indicate there was not much relevant content in the vector database to sustain answering the user question. 

## Two Flavors: UI (Front end) and API
This project allows you to access the context-driven LLM using two flavors: a UI and an API. The Gradio UI is initialized as the running application by default.

### Gradio - UI (Front end)
This is the default application choice for the AMP. You should be able to access the view through your applications nav. When it starts, you will be able to select the default model (`llama-2-7b-chat`), temperature (a good default is 1), number of tokens (a good default maybe 100), topic weight (a domain for the corpus of knowledge to prioritize), and question for the model to process. Defaults will be selected if you choose not to answer these; however, a question is required.

As a note, Gradio comes with a Python-based API option too, which is accessible from the link shown at the bottom of the Gradio interface.

### CML Models - API (Back end)
This AMP ships with a LLama2 model built for deployment in the project. Using CML models provides all the capabilities of Model scaling and adds first class support for LLM models to CML. Note that deploying this LLama2 LLM model requires adjusting the Ephemeral Storage limit to 20GB or more in the Settings of the CML environment. 

## Requirements
#### CML Instance Types
- A GPU instance is required to perform inference on the LLM
  - [CML Documentation: GPUs](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/gpu/topics/ml-gpu.html)
- A CUDA 5.0+ capable GPU instance type is recommended *(AMP will fail on Step 2 if this requirement is not met)*
  - The torch libraries in this AMP require a GPU with CUDA compute capability 5.0 or higher. (i.e. NVIDIA V100, A100, T4 GPUs)

#### Recommended Runtime
JupyterLab - Python 3.10 - Nvidia GPU - 2023.08

#### Resource Requirements
This AMP creates the following workloads with resource requirements:
- CML Session: `2 CPU, 16GB MEM`
- CML Jobs: `4 CPU, 8GB MEM`
- CML Application: `2 CPU, 1 GPU, 16GB MEM`

#### External Resources
This AMP requires pip packages and models from huggingface. Depending on your CML networking setup, you may need to whitelist some domains:
- pypi.python.org
- pypi.org
- pythonhosted.org
- huggingface.co
- pinecone.io (if using Pinecone)

## Deploying on CML
There are two ways to launch this prototype on CML:

1. **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog on a CML workspace, select the "Intelligent QA Chatbot with NiFi, Pinecone, and Llama2" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"

2. **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the [repo URL](https://github.com/cloudera/CML_AMP_Intelligent-QA-Chatbot-with-NiFi-Pinecone-and-Llama2), click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"


## The Fine Print

All the components of the application (knowledge base, context retrieval, prompt enhancement LLM) are running within CDF and CML. This application does not call any external model APIs nor require any additional training of an LLM. The knowledge base is generated using the user-passed sitemaps in NiFi (CDF) or Python, depending on the user preference.
